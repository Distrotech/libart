      <para>
	Libart is a 2D drawing library: its goal is to be a high-quality vector-based
	2D library with antialiasing and alpha composition. Libart was developed by
	Raph Levien in an attempt to provide a powerful yet easy-to-use foundation
	layer for the development of Gui-based applications in Gnome. Libart is thus
	distributed as a part of Gnome under the LGPL. Libart can also be licensed 
	under other licenses from ArtofCode<footnoteref linkend="artofcode">.

	Whether or not you are a Core HaXXor, you may be used to reading

      <para>
	The first step is to find the file containing the code that
	deals with a particular data structure.
	libart tries to make this process easy for you.
	File names are structured as follows:
	<computeroutput>art_sourcestructure_deststructure_details.{h|c}</computeroutput>.
	For example, the source file <computeroutput>art_svp_vpath.h</computeroutput>
	contains the source code which manipulates svp data structures and generates vpath 
	data structures. Most notably, the following function can be found in there:
	<function>art_svp_from_vpath</function>.

      <sect2>
	<title>Using libart</title>

	<para>
	  Using libart to display vector graphics on screen can be a pretty difficult task
	  for beginers: libart was not designed to draw vector graphics on screen. It was 
	  designed to draw graphics in pixel buffers. It is up to the reader to draw those
	  pixel buffers on screen after rendering.
	</para>

	<figure>
	  <title>LibArt's Use scenarios</title>
	  <graphic fileref="art-overall-arch.png" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	  The diagram above shows how you could use libart: the pixel buffers can be stored
	  -they could be also manipulated before doing so- but they can also be rendered on screen
	  using GTK+' Gdkrgb code.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some sample code shows how to achieve both of those scenarios by hand, but application 
	  developers should remember that it is pretty unlikely that they will have to do this. Higher-level
	  APIs which deal with structured vector graphics are available and they take care of
	  all the rendering of the vector data you feed them. The <function>GnomeCanvas</function>
	  can be used for this: its antialiased version uses libart to render vector data in pixel
	  buffers and Gdkrgb to render those pixel buffers in X windows.
	</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>From vector data to pixel buffers</title>

	<para>
	  Libart's vector input is described using 2 data structures: <function>ArtBpath</function> (short 
	  for Bezier Paths)
	  and <function>ArtVPath</function> (short for Vector Paths). libart provides a number of 
	  helper functions to manipulate these data structures and instantiate specific geometric 
	  shapes easily.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To render these data vectors to a pixel buffer, libart wants you to transform them in 
	  <function>ArtSVP</function>s (short for Sorted Vector Paths). Svps are a rendering-friendly
	  version of the original vectors. I would strongly suggest against constructing your own
	  svps by hand without using the libart's construction APIs: these SVPs need to verify a number
	  of properties which are not trivial and I have no idea what would happen if you passed
	  a corrupted svp to the rendering code (probably bad things)...
	  For example, <function>art_svp_from_vpath</function> will generate the svp corresponding
	  to your vpaths.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Once you have constructed your svps, you can manipulate those svps before rendering them.
	  It is thus possible to apply arbitrary affine transformations to those svps. It is also possible
	  to intersect 2 svps and generate the svp representing the union of these svps...
	</para>

	<para>
	  Finally, it is time for you to render your svps in a pixel buffer. This can be done 
	  pretty easily using <function>art_rgb_svp_aa</function> and/or 
	  <function>art_rgb_svp_alpha</function>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All the above steps are summarized in the following diagram:

      <title>A non-displaying application</title>

      <para>
	To get a good idea on how to use libart 
	in your own application, here is a simple example which does
	nothing but render in a pixel buffer a small square. The full 
	source for this example is available for download:
	<ulink url="./art-non-diplay.tar.gz">art-non-diplay.tar.gz</ulink>
	(includes a simple Makefile to build it).
      </para>

      <programlisting>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  ArtSVP *path;
  char *buffer;

  path = make_path ();

  buffer = render_path (path);

  save_buffer (buffer, "foo.png");

  return 0;
}
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	As shown above, we begin by creating an SVP, then we render it in a pixel buffer and
	last we save it to a file.
	Creating the SVP is very easy:
      </para>
<programlisting>
static ArtSVP *
make_path (void)
{
  ArtVpath *vec = NULL;
  ArtSVP *svp = NULL;
  
  vec = art_new (ArtVpath, 10);

  vec[4].code = ART_END;

  svp = art_svp_from_vpath (vec);

  return svp;
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
	The above VPath is a list of drawing commands. There are 5 different drawing commands:
	<function>ART_MOVETO</function>, <function>ART_MOVETO_OPEN</function>,
	<function>ART_LINETO</function>, <function>ART_CURVETO</function> an <function>ART_END</function>.
	<itemizedlist>

	    <para>
	      <function>ART_MOVETO</function> and <function>ART_MOVETO_OPEN</function> describe where the

	  <graphic fileref="art-drawing-commands.png" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>
	Once the SVP is built, we render it and save it to a file:
      </para>

<programlisting>
static unsigned char *
render_path (const ArtSVP *path)
{
  art_u8 *buffer = NULL;
  art_u32 color = (0xFF << 24) | (0x00 <<16) | (0x00<<8) | (0xFF) ; /* RRGGBBAA */
    

  buffer = art_new (art_u8, WIDTH*HEIGHT*BYTES_PER_PIXEL);
  art_rgb_run_alpha (buffer, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, WIDTH*HEIGHT);
  art_rgb_svp_alpha (path, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 
		     color, buffer, ROWSTRIDE, NULL);

  return (unsigned char *) buffer;
}

static void
save_buffer (const unsigned char *buffer, const char *filename)
{
  GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;

  pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data (buffer,
				     GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB, 
				     FALSE, 8,
				     WIDTH, HEIGHT,
				     ROWSTRIDE,
				     NULL, NULL);

  pixbuf_save_to_file (pixbuf, filename);
 
  gdk_pixbuf_unref (pixbuf);
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
	The rendering is itself pretty simple: we first fill the buffer with the 0xFFFFFFFF rgba color
	(that is, 0xFFFFFF rgb color with a transparency of 0xFF which means no transparency at all. It
	should be called opacity actually ;) with the <function>art_rgb_run_alpha</function> function.
	Then, we fill the svp in the buffer with the 0xFF0000FF rgba color with the 
	<function>art_rgb_svp_alpha</function> function.
      </para>

      <para>
	Last, to save the pixel buffer, we just instantiate a <function>GdkPixbuf</function>
	and save it with the <function>pixbuf_save_to_file</function> function we stole 
	from random pieces of code (namely, nautilus and gnome-iconedit).
      </para>

      <para>
	Easy, was it not ?
      </para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sample-display">
      <title>A displaying application</title>
      
      <para>
	Once more, the code for this example can be found 
	<ulink url="./art-display.tar.gz">there</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Now that we know how to render our data in a pixel buffer, we want to display it 
	on screen in a window. To do this, we use the gdkrgb library which transfers
	pixel buffers to the X server in Drawables.
	The code below is very similar to our previous example: we just initialize GTK+ and
	gdkrgb and instead of saving the pixel buffer to a file, we create a widget to display 
	it and run the GTK+ main loop:
      </para>

      <programlisting>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  ArtSVP *path;
  char *buffer;

  /* gtk/gdkrgb initialization */
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
  gdk_rgb_init ();
  gtk_widget_set_default_colormap(gdk_rgb_get_cmap());
  gtk_widget_set_default_visual(gdk_rgb_get_visual());

  path = make_path ();

  buffer = render_path (path);

  build_widget (buffer);

  /* gtk main loop */
  gtk_main ();

  return 0;
}
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	The only new function is <function>build_widget</function> which is shown
	below. This function just creates a drawing area and connects a drawing
	callback to the expose signal.
      </para>

      <programlisting>
static void 
build_widget (unsigned char *buffer)
{
  GtkWidget *window = NULL, *drawing_area = NULL;

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_default_size (GTK_WINDOW(window), WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "delete_event",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (destroy_cb), NULL);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (destroy_cb), NULL);
  drawing_area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window),
		     GTK_WIDGET (drawing_area));

  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (drawing_area), "expose_event",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (expose_cb), buffer);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (drawing_area), "configure_event",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (expose_cb), buffer);

  gtk_widget_show_all (window);
}
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	The expose callback is very simple: it just calls gdkrgb's entry point
	to render the pixel buffer onto the drawing area we instantiated a little
	before.
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
static int 
expose_cb (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventExpose *evt, gpointer data)
{

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
	      Libart uses floats to represent an manipulate user-data.

	  </para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>
	      The libart intersector (the code used to transform vpaths into
	      svps) is known to have some bugs. Fixing those requires a lot of
	      work and a careful re-design/re-write of the intersector. Till then,
	      Raph has not had time to fix them. Also, no one volunteered to fix 
	      them. If you have some time left on weekends and are interested in this

	The rasterizer code we will refer to is the function named <function>art_svp_render_aa</function>

      </para>

      <sect2>
	<title>Winding Number Calculation.</title>

	<para>
	  The goal of the libart rasterizer is to calculate a property for each of the pixels to render: this is
	  the <emphasis>winding number</emphasis>. This property reflects the position of a given pixel relative to
	  all the vector paths to render. It says whether or not the pixel is located <emphasis>inside</emphasis>
	  or <emphasis>outside</emphasis> a vector path. As can be seen on the folowing diagram, a point is inside
	  a given closed polygon if and only if the infinite horizontal half-line starting on the pixel and going
	  to the left intersects the enclosing polygon an odd number of times.
	</para>

	<figure>
	  <title>Inside or Outside of a polygon</title>
	  <graphic fileref="art-winding-number.png" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	  The winding number of a pixel is defined as the number of times the horizontal line intersects an up
	  segment minus the number of times the horizontal line intersects down segments (a segment being defined
	  by a pair of points A=(Ax, Ay) and B=(Bx, By), an up segment is a segment such that By > Ay). 
	  A non-zero winding number thus means the pixel is located within a polygon and must be painted.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Classicaly, the winding number property is calculated on each pixel and this information is used to paint
	  a pixel in either black or white (this is what the standard freetype renderer used to do to render
	  each character on screen). The problem here is that the output medium used by computers does not have
	  an infinite spatial resolution. Computer screens (CRTs or LCDs or even printers) draw dots with a non-zero
	  area. Each of the displayed pixel is not a point in the mathematical sense. Traditionaly, to render the
	  vector paths, we would test whether or not the center of each pixel lies within the vector path: this rendering
	  method introduces a number of well known artificial artefacts which are usually refered to as <emphasis>
	    aliasing</emphasis> artefacts.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Hopefully, there exist antialiasing techniques to minimize these aliasing artifacts. The idea behind
	  all these techniques is to fake higher resolution on the output medium by trading-off color depth for
	  spatial resolution: certain pixels are not completely turned black (they are turned grey)
	  to give viewers the feeling of smooth outines rather than jagged outlines.
	</para>

	  <figure>
	    <title>Oversampling versus Exact Coverage Calculus</title>
	    <graphic fileref="art-oversampling.png" scale="50"></graphic>
	  </figure>

	<para>
	  Traditional antialiasing algorithms use Oversampling: they render the outlines on a high-resolution
	  grid and then calculate the grey output by averaging over the high-resolution B&amp;W grid.
	  Libart instead tries to calculate the real coverage of each pixel by the outline to get better precision
	  than with oversampling.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To express this new concept (that is, partial coverage of a pixel rather than Black or White), libart
	  redefines winding numbers and uses a special data structure which is of importance to describe them:
	  <link linkend="ArtSVPRenderAAStep">ArtSVPRenderAAStep</link>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To understand how they are used, we'll use the example shown in the figure below.
	  On the bottom row of pixels, pixel 3 would be represented by the step (x=1, delta=+0.3), 
	  pixel 4 by the step (x=2, delta=+0.67) and pixels 5 and 6 by the step (x=3, delta=+0.03).
	</para>

	<para>
	  The bottom row of pixels is rendered as folows: we begin by rendering the first step which says that 
	  pixel 1 on this row is 30% covered by the outline (delta=0.3 -> 30%). The second step tells us that the 
	  second pixel on this row is (30+67)=97% covered by the outline (the difference -the delta- is of +0.67). 
	  Finally, the third step tells us that pixels 3 and folowing on this row are (97+3)=100% covered by the 
	  outline. The fourth step would tell us where the pixels are not 100% covered anymore.
	  To summarize, on a given row of pixels, each step gives us the delta (that is, the difference in coverage)
	  relative to the previous step of the current pixel.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The raster version of an outline can thus be represented relative to an output buffer by an array of arrays
	  of <link linkend="ArtSVPRenderAAStep">ArtSVPRenderAAStep</link>s. Each array of
	  <link linkend="ArtSVPRenderAAStep">ArtSVPRenderAAStep</link>s represents a row of pixels of the output buffer
	  and each step of the array of <link linkend="ArtSVPRenderAAStep">ArtSVPRenderAAStep</link>s represents
	  a <emphasis>run</emphasis> (that is, adjacent pixels with same color characteristics).
	</para>

	<para>
	  People who want to render the real pixels in the output buffer just need to calculate running sums over the 
	  steps for each line of the output buffer. The running sum represents the degree of presence of the outline
	  over the background: the outline is easy to composite over the backgound.

	<para>
	  <link linkend="art-svp-render-aa">art_svp_render_aa</link> exports the API which offers the interface
	  described in the previous section: a callback is called on each of the output buffer's line with an array
	  of <link linkend="ArtSVPRenderAAStep">ArtSVPRenderAAStep</link>s as parameter. This callback
	  just needs to calculate the running sum for this line and render the real pixels in a pixel buffer.

	  both use internally <link linkend="art-svp-render-aa">art_svp_render_aa</link> by providing different
	  callbacks. Their code is pretty simple and can be found in <filename>art_rgb_svp.c</filename> (the code

	</para>

	<para>
	  The interesting piece of code is indeed <link linkend="art-rgb-svp-aa">art_rgb_svp_aa</link>.
	  This code implements a pretty classic Plane Sweep algorithm: it loops over the output buffer's
	  lines and calculates for each line the steps for the callback. To calculate the steps,
	  it maintains over the lines the list of segments crossing the current line.

	<sect3>
	  <title>A Plane Sweep Algorithm</title>

	  <para>
	    To maintain the list of <emphasis>active</emphasis> segments (that is, segments 
	    crossing the current
	    line), the algorithm adds the segments starting on the current line and 
	    removes the segments ending on the current line. The folowing pseudo-code
	    summarizes this process for libart's (x,y) space.
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
for (y = 0; y < height; y++) {
	add_new_active_segments (active_segments, svp);
	
	process_line (active_segments, y);

	remove_old_active_segments (active_segmnts);
}
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Surprisingly enough, the svp data-structure was designed so that the two important operations
	    of this algorithm (namely, adding new active segments and removing old active segments to/from 
	    the list of active segments) are easy to implement and fast.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Let's first have a look at what the SVP data structure looks like.
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
typedef struct _ArtSVP ArtSVP;
typedef struct _ArtSVPSeg ArtSVPSeg;

struct _ArtSVPSeg {
  int n_points;
  int dir; /* == 0 for "up", 1 for "down" */
  ArtDRect bbox;
  ArtPoint *points;
};

struct _ArtSVP {
  int n_segs;
  ArtSVPSeg segs[1];
};
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Each of an SVP's segment represent a monotonous vector shape as shown on the 
	    figure below. The word <emphasis>Monotonous</emphasis> used here is to be understood
	    as <emphasis>not changing vertical direction</emphasis>: segments either go up or down.
	    A given Vector path changing his vertical direction is split in two vector paths
	    when represented by an SVP: one going up and one going down. Each segment is 
	    contained within its own bounding box stored in the <emphasis>bbox</emphasis> field.
	  </para>

	    <title>VPath to SVP</title>
	    <graphic fileref="art-svp-vpath.png" scale="50"></graphic>
	  </figure>


	  <para>
	    The segments listed in an SVP are ordered using their starting points as shown
	    in <emphasis>art_svp_seg_compare</emphasis> (from <filename>art_svp.c</filename>)
	    from top to bottom, left to right.
	    The ordering of the segments and their bounding boxes allows one to easily parse 
	    the list of segments of an svp to update the list of active segments:
	  </para>

	  <programlisting>
  for (y = y0; y < y1; y++)
    {
      /* insert new active segments */
      for (; i < svp->n_segs && svp->segs[i].bbox.y0 < y + 1; i++)
	{
	  if (svp->segs[i].bbox.y1 > y &&
	      svp->segs[i].bbox.x0 < x1)
	    {
	      seg = &amp;svp->segs[i];
	      /* move cursor to topmost vector which overlaps [y,y+1) */
	      for (curs = 0; seg->points[curs + 1].y < y; curs++);
	      cursor[i] = curs;
	      dy = seg->points[curs + 1].y - seg->points[curs].y;
	      if (fabs (dy) >= EPSILON)
		seg_dx[i] = (seg->points[curs + 1].x - seg->points[curs].x) /
		  dy;
	      else
		seg_dx[i] = 1e12;
	      seg_x[i] = seg->points[curs].x +
		(y - seg->points[curs].y) * seg_dx[i];
	      art_svp_render_insert_active (i, active_segs, n_active_segs++,
					    seg_x, seg_dx);
	    }
	}


	  /* here, process the current list of active segments.*/


	/* remove old segments from active list */
	if (seg->points[curs].y >= y + 1)
	  {
	    curs--;
	    cursor[seg_index] = curs;
	    seg_x[seg_index] += seg_dx[seg_index];
	  }
	else
	  {
	    art_svp_render_delete_active (active_segs, j--,
					    --n_active_segs);
	  }
    }
