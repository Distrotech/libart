	* art_svp_render_aa.c (art_svp_render_aa): Changed the api
	slightly, to guarantee that the steps are all within the range
	from x0 (inclusive) to x1 (exclusive).

	* art_gray_svp.c, art_gray_svp.h: Added. Populated with functions
	to render into a simple graymap.

	* art_rgb.c, art_rgb.c: Added. Populated with fill_run and
	run_alpha methods.

	* art_rgb_svp.c, art_rgb_svp.h: Added. Populated with functions to
	render into an RGB buffer, and to composite over an RGB buffer.

	* Makefile.am: added art_gray_svp, art_rgb, and art_rgb_svp.

	* testart.c: test the color and layered rendering.

	* testart.c: added vector path rendering stuff. Some of it needs
	to go out of the test framework and into the module, but the
	api hasn't settled down entirely yet (in the real code, all
	x's in the step field are within bounds).

	* art_svp_render_aa.c, art_svp_render_aa.c.h: added.

	* art_svp_vpath.c, art_svp_vpath.h: added.

	* art_pathcode.h: added ART_MOVETO_OPEN (libart uses an
	ART_MOVETO_OPEN code at the beginning to indicate an open path,
	while PostScript uses the lack of a closepath at the end).

	* art_vpath_bpath.c, art_vpath_bpath.h: fixed it up, added
	flatness arg to api.

	* Makefile.am: added new source files.

Wed Nov 25 17:19:44 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* art_svp.h, art_svp.c: added, basic constructors for sorted
	vector paths.

Sun Nov 22 23:21:09 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am (libart_lgplincdir): Fixed stupid bug in naming of
	the variable.

Sun Nov 22 21:41:13 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* art_uta_vpath.c: moved art_uta_union into art_uta_ops.

	* art_uta_ops.[ch]: added, populated with art_uta_union.

Thu Nov 19 00:19:40 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* libartConf.sh.in: added

	* Makefile.am: added creation of libartConf.sh, added -version-info
	* configure.in: added LIBART_VERSION_INFO, support for libartConf.sh
	
	* libart.m4: updated version history :)

Wed Nov 18 18:15:20 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (LIBART_VERSION): set this, so that libart-config
	--version now works.

Wed Nov 18 16:50:58 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* libart.m4: added (just copied from esound)
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: added support for libart-config
	* libart-config.in: added (mostly copied from esound)

	* Getting the library in shape for initial checkin to CVS.
